//Brewery Tour//<br>
-Brewery tour was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jquery-

The app melds together the BreweryDB API and the GoogleMaps API. Using both in conjunction with eachother to produce
a high quality, exploratory experience. All the while letting the user accomplish his/her end goal, of finding
great craft beer!

Brewery Tour was born out of my love for craft beer, and my interest in travel. It is designed to help connect
beer lovers with their favorite craft breweries.
